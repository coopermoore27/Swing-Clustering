# Swing-Clustering
School project which clusters batter's swings based on attack angle and swing tilt, then tests for significance to see if some clusters perform better against certain pitch types or pitch locations

Cluster was the original notebook which uses EVI_CQ, VBA_All, pstatcast, and statcast as inputs

Term_Project_209 is the paper I turned in for a grade

Cluster2 is a revised version which uses statcast (pybaseball) to get swing path data
